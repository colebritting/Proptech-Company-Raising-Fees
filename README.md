# Proptech-Company-Raising-Fees
A proptech company currently manages thousands of homes across the United States. They are wondering how much their ARR will increase given various increases to their porperty management fees and leasing fees. These increases are dependent on both the market the property is in and how many units the owner has on the platform. The company is also wondering what are the best ways to prioritize this effort. Are there certain fees they should raise first? Certain markets? Is the plan viable in totality? 

I first clean the data, format it to be more easily analyzed, and then explore it too give the company some insights.
